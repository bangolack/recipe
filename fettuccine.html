    <p>This is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur and he scrapes the pan every time! I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health conscious. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>¾ pint heavy cream</li>
        <li>alt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</p>
