    <p>A simple, healthy snack made from pureed blueberries, chia seeds, a touch of honey, and water. Full of healthy fats, protein, and fiber!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chia seeds</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp honey or more, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>To a blender, add blueberries, water, and honey. Blend on high until puree forms, approx. 1 minute.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>To a jar or bowl (the one you'll eat out of!) add chia seeds. Add blueberry puree to chia seeds.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Add lemon juice and honey to jar or bowl. Stir the mixture well, ensuring chia seeds are evenly distributed and not stuck together.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Place jar or bowl in the fridge for 2 hours or overnight. You'll know it's done when it thickens up a bit. Enjoy with a spoon or straw! Store in the fridge for up to a week.</p>
